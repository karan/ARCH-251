**Khandariya Mahadeva Temple built by Chandellas**

- Rajputs were tribals
- Gujara, Pratihara and Rashtrakutas(??) were competing.
	- No one emerged as a single dominant force
    - Pratiharas had bigger cities, and collected tax
    	- Vast amounts of tribal land
        - Kings try to buy tribals and arm them
        	- Tribals had this leverage, go to other king. So better negotiation.
            - Asked for recognition - to be kings to kings
- Rajputs acquired caste now
	- demanded their terms
    - became new "kings"
	- = "sons of kings"
- Between 800-1200, more temples built than ever
	- Rajputs wanted to be kings, so build temples

##Vastu-Shastra

- Kings wrote the techniques of temple-building
- Building knowledge
- Always agree with each other
- Work through intersection of square (directions), circle (time) with radial geometry (like spokes of tire).
- Derived from geometry of altars of system of Aryas

## Morphogenesis

**Metaphysics of temple form**

### Khajuraho

- Mountains (temples) look like Himalayas
- Mountains connect land to heaven
- Every temple is a recreation of order of Mt Kailash
	- Not to copy it, not to look like MK
    - It recreates idea
    - Shunya is top of the temple - all rest under it is how from shunya everything comes into being
    - Mountain is a metaphor to explain the organization of the atomos/cosmography
- Literally climb up the mountain to reach shunya


- Towards the bottom, images are human understandable
- Towards the top, it becomes geometric shape
	- Not understood by humans


- Upper part is the model of cosmos
- Lower part is the shrine - operative and functional

#####Upper part

- Descending levels
- Formless to form - Conceptually perfect order to slightly perfect order
- Order evolves from shunya (0,0)


- Temples are fractals: smaller parts look like whole.
- Form recreates itself: parivar (family)
- Well-ordered parivar matters: no chaos
	- **Model of time**
- Through dance, show how forms change in time - superior to architecture


##### Sun = parent of humans

- Sun is where our horizon meets the 'other' horizon.
- Sun is the point of irruption into our fractal sub-sphere
	- East is the main point of geometry


#### Sex

- "erotic scultures" - not secretive, not the focus: just in there, part of the scene
- Found at the zone of transition on temples


## Ritual and performance

- Inner most shrine/cave = womb = *garbh briha*, ie cosmic womb.
- Entering into temple = entering the body of comos
- The mountain creates a "fissure" around the shrine so you can go around.


## Space-Time + Life = Eventing, or the sexual core as the progenitor of life

- Shiva is "running the show"
- Phallic form in the female
- +1 and -1 meet = 0
- **Tantraism** - people believe that through some stuff (sexual union) you can skyshot your karma


----

**Nirvana** - The axis of nirvana = the conceptual axis: where vertical axis and the axis of access meet.
