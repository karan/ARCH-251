- Land based trading route

- All civilizations on the route were brought down by colonization.
	- circumvented by ships going around in the ocean
	- land-based means a lot of intermediaries involved => high price at end, material lost
	- ships could carry a lot of material, without intermediaries
	- ships could control price and quantity

#### The Renaissance

- so called because it was a 'rebirth' of certian classical ideas that had been long lost to Western Europe.
- the fuel for this was rediscovery of ancient texts that had been forgotten by Western civilization, but were preserved in Byzantine Empire, the Islamic world, and some monastic libraries.

#### The advent of modernity, 1492++

- The Arabs knew the world was round - they needed astronomy for building mosques
- They didn't send ships because they were already making money cuz of Silk Route

-----------

- Isabella, queen of Spain, wanted spices from India, paid a lot for it
- That's what Silk Route was used for.
- Spices are used for preserving meat - kind of like refrigerator.
