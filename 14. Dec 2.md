Postcolonial Modernism
=============

*Dec 2, 2013*

### Mahatama Gandhi

- Used the works of Ruskins, Tolstoy
- Used a spinning wheel
- +Gita
- Went to meet Lord Baton to negotiate independence

### India's Independence, 1947

- First time made a nation - a single political entity
- Pak created for muslim "minority" - put forth by Md Jinnah
	- English agreed to this claim

### Third World Mordernim - Nehru's Chandigarh

*"Let this be a new city, unfetted by the past, a symbol of the nation's faith in the future."* \- Nehru

- Not a religion-centric city
- Modern city with modern architecture

### The Making of Chandigarh, 1950-65

- Between 2 rivers
- Designed by Le Corbusier
- Laid out in form of clean grids - 1/2 mile x 3/4 mile
- Neighbourhood was internal looking - each called a sector
- fast moving traffic on the outside

#### Capitol Complex

- Dug out roads, and used the earth dug out to make hills around the complex
	- The cars were submerged
		- Make the pedestrians separated
		- Predestrians remain primary
	- The complex was hidden from the city due to the hills
		- North of capitol were Himalayas, so became a part of the scene
		- For a moderinist, things have to be designed in nature
- Buildings made in squares (not really :P)

##### High Court

- Horizontal Symmetry - View from front = bird's eye view
- Can rotate building - one rotation gives the plan, another gives the reflection in water (refer to lecture)
- Has 2 umbrellas - roof on a roof
	- shell of law, or
	- umbrellas on top = stupas
	- Provides shade on roof - cools the main roof

###### Governer's House

- Very royal design, planned to be at the center of all this
- Rejected by Nehru (jelesousy, probably)

##### Parliament

- Power house kind of thing on top cut in an angle
- Roof on entrance looks like a bull
