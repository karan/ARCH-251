## The Arrival of Islam in India

Starting 1000CE, Muhammad of Ghazni is said to have raided Western India about 26 times, each time to plunder and destroy temples, and supposedly kill as many Hindus as he could. In 1026CE he is supposed to have plundered Somnath. Claims to have destroyed the idol, killed 50,000 kafirs (infidels) and carried off a bounty of fabolous proportions.

- 1050CE - Rajput Kingdoms
- 1103-10CE - Rajarajesvaram, Thanjavur
- Gangas of Bhubneshvar in North. Lingaraja temple, Bhubnesvara, 1050CE
	- Huge temple
- Sun temple (surya temple), Konark


- No mention of Ghazni in Hindu texts - so much going on in North (temples and shit), that no one cared about what he did.
- Until 19th Century, no one had heard of Ghazni - when English starting finding and writing about him.

- Outside = really tall

- It is on stairs, so it looks really big from outside


- Entirely made of red sandstone

**After this**

- Built an entire palace to go with mosque
- Many, many courtyards - for people, queens etc
- The plan staggers along a diagonal
	- The complex sits on a ridge (escarpment)
		- NE-SW
	- Mosque has to face west, so it's at an angle to ridge
	- Other building/complexes also aligned with the mosque
	- therefore, the stagger

- Inside, just 1 column
- Akbar sat on top of column
- Used to listen to peoples' grievences who used to stand on floor
- A lot of religious priests in the "court" to get them to sort out the God

- Made this building to enable this concept
- At the 4 corners of the column would be people of different religions
